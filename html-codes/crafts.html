            <div>
                It is so common that we present gifts to our friends and family. But did you ever so satisfied after you gift something to them or after seeing their reaction at your gift.
            </div>

            <div>
                Though I present a costly gift to someone, I feel it so materialistic that I never get satisfied. So I feel making personalized gifts that made by ourselves are so special. It's never about the price of the gift. It's about the priority and place they hold in my heart.
            </div>

            <div>
                And its never the destination (final output). Its always about the journey. The time we invest in it. The efforts we make that matters the most. So, here are some of the process videos of the gifts that made for my closed ones.
