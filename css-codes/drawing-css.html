                    Art is a form <strong><i>expression</i></strong>. Art includes a diverse range of activities that involves creativity and imagination. It comes with a lot of emotional power and conceptual ideas.

                    And I, express my emotions in the form of art. Be it happiness, sadness, confusion any kind of emotion. I believe art conveys better than words. So heres a little glance at my art work that I drew on different situaions with different emotions.

                <p>Everybody says <i>time heals everything</i>. But I don't think so.</p>
                <p>I feel, there will be different situations in our life that we go through at different times..<div>All those situations make us realise what's really worth our energy, and any emotions that hold us back.</div></p>
                <p>So with time, with situations we will know how to deal with and react to them. <span>Though we learn how to live with the pain, somewhere that scar never fades away and keep haunting at us from nowhere.</span></p>
                <p>So, this drawing is all about that. Depicting the scars from past, being and enjoying the present in little happiness and a hope and desire about the future.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Art is <strong><i>celebration</i></strong>.</p>
                <p>Some celebrating by playing loud musics and some celebrate by going to tours. I agree, everybodies way of celebrating or expressing themselves is different.</p>
                <p>But Me! I won't get a feeling of celebration or simply I can't feel complete or happy unless I express it in my way.</p>
                <p>It feels like doing somthing unique and making my day even more special.</p>
                <p>So, this is about my diwali festival. While evryone arund me were sending time with eachother, I was busy for the whole day to make these diyas so that we can use these for lighting in the evening during the festival time.</p>
                <p>Everyone enjoyed firing the crackers and i enjoyed lighting the special diyas that i made by myself.</p>

                <p>Art is <strong><i>a form of expressing gratitude</i></strong>.</p>
                <p>Words fell short when we really try to extend our gratitude to someone and especially when they are our loved ones. And to the situations, to the learners we can never thank on a particular note.</p>
                <p>It was my 25th birthday and im really really really really grateful for all the memories, love, affection, learnings, hatered.</p>
                <p>In the same context, I did my first doodle art to thank everyone, every thing and every second.</p>

                <p>Art is a <strong><i>therapy</i></strong>.</p>
                <p>Brain is the biggest enemy. Sometimes, even for the smallest things we keep thinking alot and get may negative feelings.</p>
                <p>Dont you think its all becuase of thinking too much. We people don't need to be impressoned in jails oe elsewhere. We are already impressonedin our own thoughts.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, by expressing our grief through art can make us feel much better instead of waiting for someone to listen to us. and though listened, what if they understand or get you wrong. With art, you have any such extra burdens. You can peacefully express your thoughts and come out of your sadness.</p>
