                    It is so common that we present gifts to our friends and family. But did you ever so satisfied after you gift something to them or after seeing their reaction at your gift.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though I present a costly gift to someone, I feel it so materialistic that I never get satisfied. So I feel making personalized gifts that made by ourselves are so special. It's never about the price of the gift. It's about the priority and place they hold in my heart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And its never the destination (final output). Its always about the journey. The time we invest in it. The efforts we make that matters the most. So, here are some of the process videos of the gifts that made for my closed ones.

                <p>When we talk about festivals, its not just celebrating them at home. Just remember our childhood, we used to celebrate all the festivals in our schools and colleges few days before the holidays commences.</p>
                <p>It was Dassseshra and one of cousins works at a diploma college near by our home town. She asked me make a background decoration for the durga maa idol to place that behind the head of the idol.</p>
                <p>This is a small video of mine making the decoration on a thermocol sheet which she later used to decorate the durga maa idol.</p>
