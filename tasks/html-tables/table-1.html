        ### Question 1: Nested Tables <br>
        Create an HTML table that contains another table within one of its cells. The outer table should have 3 rows and 3 columns. <br>The nested table should be placed in the middle cell (2nd row, 2nd column) and should have 2 rows and 2 columns. <br> Include appropriate headers and data for both tables.
